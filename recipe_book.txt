Introduction	


	Being a group of University students, we know all too well of the troubles and annoyances that arise when it comes to having to cook for oneself
	every night while also trying to balance both school and social lives. 
	This is why, through this book, we believe that we can offer students healthy and quick meals, that do not take a large toll on the bank account either! 
	The dishes have been carefully selected in order to satisfy the needs of a balanced diet and include dishes from all different kinds of cuisines.
	Specific priority was also placed on having the ingredients being easy to find in order to not cause a commute to find them.
	By compiling this book, we hope to take your taste buds on an adventure, to cook different dishes that you would have never dreamed of producing before
	and to ignite a passion for cooking in more students

2) Carrot Cake

	Ingredients
		
		Dairy
			100g natural yogurt
			100g slightly salted butter
			100g full-fat cream cheese, softened

		Vegetables
			265g carrots (about 3), grated

		Fruit
			½ an orange, zested
			100g sultanas or raisins

		Oils
			235ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin
			1½ tsp vanilla extract

		Herbs & Spices
			2½ tsp ground cinnamon
			¼ fresh nutmeg, finely grated

		Carbohydrates
			335g light muscovado sugar		
			300g icing sugar

		Grains
			265g self-raising flour

		Protein
			4 large eggs

		Nuts
			100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)


	Steps

		1) Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.
		2) Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins.
		3) To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. Add half the cream cheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts. Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.

3) Cinnamon Roll Pancakes

	Ingredients

		Dairy
			3/4 cup milk
			1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons butter, melted
			1/4 cup butter, softened
			2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature

		Oils
			2 teaspoons vanilla extract
			
		Herbs & Spices
			1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

		Carbohydrates
			2 tablespoons white sugar
			5 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
			3/4 cup confectioners' sugar

		Grains
			1 cup all-purpose flour
			1 teaspoon baking powder

		Protein
			1 egg

		Addatives
			2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar
			1/2 teaspoon baking soda
			1/2 teaspoon salt
			cooking spray


	Steps

		1) Stir milk and vinegar together in a bowl; set aside until milk "sours", about 5 minutes.
		2) Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Whisk egg, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract into milk mixture. Slowly pour milk mixture into flour mixture while whisking constantly until batter is just moistened and evenly mixed. Lumps are fine.
		3) Combine brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Place a 1-quart resealable bag into a glass or cup. Pour cinnamon mixture into the bag; refrigerate until filling is as thick as toothpaste, about 10 minutes.
		4) Mix 1/4 cup softened butter and cream cheese together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave for 40 seconds. Stir mixture with a whisk or fork until smooth. Continue heating in microwave and stirring until mixture is completely melted. Stir confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture until icing is smooth.
		5) Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Pour about 2/3 cup batter into the center of griddle. Cook pancake until bubbles start to appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Cut 1 corner off the center of the bag with filling. Swirl filling over pancake, leaving enough space around edges that filling doesn't touch the griddle.
		6) Flip pancake and cook until other side is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle icing over pancake. Repeat with remaining ingredients, spraying the griddle with cooking spray between each pancake.

	Tip: Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.

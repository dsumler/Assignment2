					Introduction	


	Being a group of University students, we know all too well of the troubles and annoyances that arise when it comes to having to cook for oneself

	every night while also trying to balance both school and social lives. 

	This is why, through this book, we believe that we can offer students healthy and quick meals, that do not take a large toll on the bank account either! 

	The dishes have been carefully selected in order to satisfy the needs of a balanced diet and include dishes from all different kinds of cuisines.

	Specific priority was also placed on having the ingredients being easy to find in order to not cause a commute to find them.

	By compiling this book, we hope to take your taste buds on an adventure, to cook different dishes that you would have never dreamed of producing before

	and to ignite a passion for cooking in more students

4) Bruschetta



Ingredients:



	Vegetables

		2 cloves of minced garlic

	Bread

		1 baguette (French bread or similar Italian bread)

	Fruit

		7 ripe tomatoes

	Oils

		1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil

		1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar

		1/4 cup olive oil

	Herbs & Spices

		6-8 fresh basil leaves

		1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper



Method of preparation:



1. Blanch and peel the tomatoes: 

   Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. 

   As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).

   Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. 

   Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.

   Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. 

   Then gently peel off the tomato skins. 

   Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.

   Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.



2. Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.



3. Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: 

   Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. 

   Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.

   Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste.



4. Toast the baguette slices: 

   Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. 

   Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.

   When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.



5. Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: 

   Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).

   Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. 

   If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

					Main Courses 



1) Vegetarian Risotto



Ingredients:

           Vegetables

                     1 medium, finely chopped onion

                     250g Fresh Porcini Mushrooms

           Sauces

                     Vegetable Broth

           Oils

                     extra virgin olive oil

           Starch

                     500g of Arborio Rice

           Alcohol

                     White wine



Method of preparation:



1. If using fresh mushrooms, trim off their roots, 

   clean off any lingering dirt with a pastry brush, 

   and cut them into strips or dice.

   If using dried mushrooms, soak them for 20 minutes,

   or until soft, in lukewarm water, then drain them, reserving the liquid,

   squeeze them dry and chop them roughly.



2. Sauté the onion over gentle heat in a nob of butter,

   or in a mixture of equal parts butter and olive oil,

   until the onions have softened and are just starting to turn color.

   Raise the heat a bit, add the mushrooms and let them soak up the

   flavors of the onion for a few minutes,

   until they are also soft and any liquid has cooked off.



3. Add the rice and let it, too,

   soak up the flavors of the onion and mushroom.

   When the rice has turned a chalky white,

   add a splash of white wine and let that cook off.



4. Now, following the usual technique for making risotto,

   add the broth, one ladleful at a time,

   letting each ladleful cook off before adding the rest.

   (If you’re using dried mushrooms, add their soaking liquid along the way,

   making sure that any grit stays behind.)

   The heat should be moderate,

   so that it bubbles in a lively but not violent way.

   The rice should take about 20 minutes total to cook.



5. When the rice is done, take if off heat and add the grated cheese and,

   if you like an even richer risotto, another nob of butter.

   Stir vigorously for about a minute,

   so that the rice becomes creamy and smooth.



             Serve immediately.

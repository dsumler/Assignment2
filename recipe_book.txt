					Vegitarian Introduction	



	Being a group of University students, we  know all too well of the troubles and annoyances that arise when it comes to having to cook for oneself
	every night while also trying to balance both school and social lives. 
	This is why, through this book, we believe that we can offer students healthy and quick meals, that do not take a large toll on the bank account either! 
	The dishes have been carefully selected in order to satisfy the needs of a balanced diet and include dishes from all different kinds of cuisines.
	Specific priority was also placed on having the ingredients being easy to find in order to not cause a commute to find them.
	By compiling this book, we hope to take your taste buds on an adventure, to cook different dishes that you would have never dreamed of producing before
	and to ignite a passion for cooking in more students

				Main Courses
1)CAPRESE PASTA SALAD

Ingredients:

Dairy
1 mozzarella ball torn into bite sized pieces

Vegetables
2 pints of cherry tomatoes
8 leaves of basil chopped up

Oils
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 to 3 tsp of baslamic vinegar

Herbs & Spices

Grains
2 cups hwole grain Fuisilli

Addatives
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt


Preparation

1. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta until al dente,
   according to package instructions. Drain the pasta and set it aside.

2. While the pasta is cooking, combine the olive oil, tomatoes and salt in a large,
   non-reactive skillet or Dutch oven over medium heat.
   Cover the skillet (use a baking sheet if you don’t have a better lid).
   Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the tomatoes have started to burst
   out of their skins and the olive oil has a light red hue (about 6 to 12 minutes).
   
3. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the cooked pasta.
   Let the mixture cool for a few minutes while you chop the basil.

4. Stir the mozzarella balls and basil into the pasta.
   Add the vinegar, then taste and add additional vinegar and/or salt,
   if it doesn’t quite taste spectacular yet. For best flavor,
   let the mixture rest for about 20 minutes,
   so the pasta can absorb some of the sauce. Or, refrigerate it for future use.

5. This salad will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.
   Leftovers are great chilled or at room temperature.
   You can also reheat the pasta if you don’t mind the mozzarella melting.

2) CHEDDAR BROCCOLI CASSEROLE

Ingredients:

2 cups vegetable broth or water
1 cup quinoa (any color), rinsed under running water in a mesh sieve for a minute and drained
16 ounces broccoli florets, either pre-packaged or sliced from 2 large bunches of broccoli
2 tablespoons olive oil
¾ teaspoon salt
10 twists of freshly ground black pepper
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, omit if sensitive to spice
8 ounces (about 2 ½ cups) freshly grated cheddar cheese, divided
1 cup low-fat milk (cow’s milk tastes best but unsweetened plain almond milk works, too)
½ tablespoon butter or 1 ½ teaspoons olive oil
1 clove garlic, pressed or minced
1 slice whole wheat bread

Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Line a large, rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper for easy cleanup.
   
2. To cook the quinoa: Bring the vegetable broth or water to boil in a heavy-bottomed,
   medium-sized pot. Add the quinoa, reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered,
   for 17 to 20 minutes, or until all of the liquid is absorbed.
   Cover and set aside to steam for 10 minutes.
   
3. To roast the broccoli: Slice any large broccoli florets in half to make bite-sized pieces.
   Transfer the broccoli to your prepared baking sheet and toss with 2 tablespoons olive oil,
   until lightly coated on all sides. Sprinkle with salt and arrange in a single layer.
   Bake for about 20 minutes,
   until the broccoli is tender and starting to caramelize on the edges.

4. To make the breadcrumbs: Tear your piece of bread into bite-sized pieces and toss them
   into a food processor or blender.
   Process until the bread has broken into small crumbs.
   In a small pan over medium heat, melt the butter.
   Add the garlic and cook just until fragrant, stirring often.
   Add the bread crumbs and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until slightly browned and crisp.
   Set aside to cool. (If you cooked your bread crumbs in a cast iron skillet,
   transfer them to a bowl to prevent them from burning.)

5. Reduce the oven heat to 350 degrees.
   Add the salt, pepper and red pepper flakes to the pot of quinoa, and stir to combine.
   Set aside ¾ cup of the cheese for later, then add the rest of the cheese to the pot.
   Pour in the milk and stir until the cheese and milk are evenly incorporated in the quinoa.

6. Pour the cheesy quinoa into a 9-inch square baking dish and top with the roasted broccoli.
   Stir until the broccoli is evenly mixed in with the quinoa.
   Sprinkle the surface of the casserole with the reserved ¾ cup cheese,
   then sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top.

7. Bake, uncovered, for 25 minutes, until the top is golden.
   Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving.

3) VEGETABLE FRIED RICE

Ingredients

1 ½ teaspoons + 2 tablespoons avocado oil or safflower oil, divided
2 eggs, whisked together
1 small white onion, finely chopped (about 1 cup)
2 medium carrots, finely chopped (about ½ cup)
2 cups additional veggies, cut into very small pieces for quick cooking.*
*options include snow peas, asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, bell pepper
¼ teaspoon salt, more to taste
1 tablespoon grated or finely minced fresh ginger
2 large cloves garlic, pressed or minced
Pinch of red pepper flakes
2 cups cooked brown rice (*see notes!)
1 cup greens (optional), such as spinach, baby kale or tatsoi
3 green onions, chopped
1 tablespoon reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce**
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
Chili-garlic sauce or sriracha, for serving (optional)

Preparation:

1. This recipe comes together quickly. Before you get started,
   make sure that all of your ingredients are prepped and within an arm’s reach from the stove.
   Also have an empty bowl nearby for holding the cooked eggs and veggies.
   I’m suggesting that you start over medium-high heat,
   but if at any point you catch a whiff of oil or food burning, reduce the heat to medium.

2. Warm a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium-high heat
   until a few drops of water evaporate within a couple of seconds.
   Immediately add 1 ½ teaspoons of oil and swirl the pan to coat the bottom.
   Add the scrambled eggs and swirl the pan so they cover the bottom.
   Cook until they are just lightly set, flipping or stirring along the way.
   Transfer the eggs to a bowl and wipe out the pan with a heat-proof spatula.

3. Return the pan to heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil.
   Add the onion and carrots and cook, stirring often,
   until the onions are translucent and the carrots are tender,
   about 3 to 5 minutes.

4. Add the remaining veggies and salt.
   Continue cooking, stirring occasionally
   (don’t stir too often, or the veggies won’t have a chance to turn golden on the edges),
   until the veggies are cooked through and turning golden, about 3 to 5 more minutes.
   In the meantime, use the edge of your spatula or a spoon
   to break up the scrambled eggs into smaller pieces.

5. Use a big spatula or spoon to transfer the contents of the pan to the bowl with the
   cooked eggs. Return the pan to heat and the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.
   Add the ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes,
   and cook until fragrant while stirring constantly, about 30 seconds.
   Add the rice and mix it all together. Cook, stirring occasionally,
   until the rice is hot and starting to turn golden on the edges, about 3 to 5 minutes.

6. Add the greens (if using) and green onions, and stir to combine.
   Add the cooked veggies and eggs and stir to combine.
   Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the tamari and sesame oil.
   Taste, and add a little more tamari if you’d like more soy flavor
   (don’t overdo it or it will drown out the other flavors) or salt,
   if the dish needs an extra boost of overall flavor.

7. Divide into bowls and serve immediately.
   I usually serve mine with chili-garlic sauce or sriracha on the side.
   Leftovers store well in the refrigerator, covered,
   for 3 to 4 days
   (if you used purple cabbage, it might stain your scrambled eggs a funny blue color,
   but it’s fine to eat).

2) Carrot Cake

	Ingredients
		
		Dairy
			100g natural yogurt
			100g slightly salted butter
			100g full-fat cream cheese, softened

		Vegetables
			265g carrots (about 3), grated

		Fruit
			½ an orange, zested
			100g sultanas or raisins

		Oils
			235ml vegetable oil, plus extra for the tin
			1½ tsp vanilla extract

		Herbs & Spices
			2½ tsp ground cinnamon
			¼ fresh nutmeg, finely grated

		Carbohydrates
			335g light muscovado sugar		
			300g icing sugar

		Grains
			265g self-raising flour

		Protein
			4 large eggs

		Nuts
			100g walnuts or pecans, roughly chopped (optional)


	Steps

		1) Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base and sides of two 20cm cake tins with baking parchment. Whisk the oil, yogurt, eggs, vanilla and zest in a jug. Mix the flour, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg with a good pinch of salt in a bowl. Squeeze any lumps of sugar through your fingers, shaking the bowl a few times to bring the lumps to the surface.
		2) Add the wet ingredients to the dry, along with the carrots, raisins and half the nuts, if using. Mix well to combine, then divide between the tins. Bake for 25-30 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. If any wet mixture clings to the skewer, return to the oven for 5 mins, then check again. Leave to cool in the tins.
		3) To make the icing, beat the butter and sugar together until smooth. Add half the cream cheese and beat again, then add the rest (adding it bit by bit prevents the icing from splitting). Remove the cakes from the tins and sandwich together with half the icing. Top with the remaining icing and scatter with the remaining walnuts. Will keep in the fridge for up to five days. Best eaten at room temperature.

3) Cinnamon Roll Pancakes

	Ingredients

		Dairy
			3/4 cup milk
			1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons butter, melted
			1/4 cup butter, softened
			2 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature

		Oils
			2 teaspoons vanilla extract
			
		Herbs & Spices
			1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon

		Carbohydrates
			2 tablespoons white sugar
			5 1/2 tablespoons packed brown sugar
			3/4 cup confectioners' sugar

		Grains
			1 cup all-purpose flour
			1 teaspoon baking powder

		Protein
			1 egg

		Addatives
			2 tablespoons white distilled vinegar
			1/2 teaspoon baking soda
			1/2 teaspoon salt
			cooking spray

	Steps

		1) Stir milk and vinegar together in a bowl; set aside until milk "sours", about 5 minutes.
		2) Mix flour, white sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a separate bowl. Whisk egg, 2 tablespoons melted butter, and 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract into milk mixture. Slowly pour milk mixture into flour mixture while whisking constantly until batter is just moistened and evenly mixed. Lumps are fine.
		3) Combine brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, and cinnamon in a small bowl. Place a 1-quart resealable bag into a glass or cup. Pour cinnamon mixture into the bag; refrigerate until filling is as thick as toothpaste, about 10 minutes.
		4) Mix 1/4 cup softened butter and cream cheese together in a microwave-safe bowl; heat in microwave for 40 seconds. Stir mixture with a whisk or fork until smooth. Continue heating in microwave and stirring until mixture is completely melted. Stir confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract into cream cheese mixture until icing is smooth.
		5) Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat and spray with cooking spray. Pour about 2/3 cup batter into the center of griddle. Cook pancake until bubbles start to appear, 2 to 3 minutes. Cut 1 corner off the center of the bag with filling. Swirl filling over pancake, leaving enough space around edges that filling doesn't touch the griddle.
		6) Flip pancake and cook until other side is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle icing over pancake. Repeat with remaining ingredients, spraying the griddle with cooking spray between each pancake.

	Tip: Aluminum foil helps keep food moist, ensures it cooks evenly, keeps leftovers fresh, and makes clean-up easy.

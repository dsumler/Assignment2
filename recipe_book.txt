					Pizza Pasta Introduction	


	Being a group of University students, we know all too well of the troubles and annoyances that arise when it comes to having to cook for oneself
	every night while also trying to balance both school and social lives. 
	This is why, through this book, we believe that we can offer students healthy and quick meals, that do not take a large toll on the bank account either! 
	The dishes have been carefully selected in order to satisfy the needs of a balanced diet and include dishes from all different kinds of cuisines.
	Specific priority was also placed on having the ingredients being easy to find in order to not cause a commute to find them.
	By compiling this book, we hope to take your taste buds on an adventure, to cook different dishes that you would have never dreamed of producing before
	and to ignite a passion for cooking in more students

3) Bruschetta

Ingredients:

	Vegetables
		2 cloves of minced garlic
	Bread
		1 baguette (French bread or similar Italian bread)
	Fruit
		7 ripe tomatoes
	Oils
		1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil
		1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
		1/4 cup olive oil
	Herbs & Spices
		6-8 fresh basil leaves
		1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Method of preparation:

1. Blanch and peel the tomatoes: 
   Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. 
   As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).
   Once the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. 
   Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.
   Remove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. 
   Then gently peel off the tomato skins. 
   Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.
   Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.

2. Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.

3. Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: 
   Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. 
   Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.
   Stir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste.

4. Toast the baguette slices: 
   Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. 
   Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.
   When the oven has reached 450°F (230°C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.

5. Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: 
   Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).
   Either serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. 
   If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.

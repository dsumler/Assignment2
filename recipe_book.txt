1) Vegetarian Risotto

   Ingredients
           Vegetables
                     1 medium, finely chopped onion
                     250g Fresh Porcini Mushrooms
           Sauces
                     Vegetable Broth
           Oils
                     extra virgin olive oil
           Starch
                     500g of Arborio Rice
           Alcohol
                     White wiine

Preparation

1. If using fresh mushrooms, trim off their roots, 
   clean off any lingering dirt with a pastry brush, 
   and cut them into strips or dice.
   If using dried mushrooms, soak them for 20 minutes,
   or until soft, in lukewarm water, then drain them, reserving the liquid,
   squeeze them dry and chop them roughly.

2. Sauté the onion over gentle heat in a nob of butter,
   or in a mixture of equal parts butter and olive oil,
   until the onions have softened and are just starting to turn color.
   Raise the heat a bit, add the mushrooms and let them soak up the
   flavors of the onion for a few minutes,
   until they are also soft and any liquid has cooked off.

3. Add the rice and let it, too,
   soak up the flavors of the onion and mushroom.
   When the rice has turned a chalky white,
   add a splash of white wine and let that cook off.

4. Now, following the usual technique for making risotto,
   add the broth, one ladleful at a time,
   letting each ladleful cook off before adding the rest.
   (If you’re using dried mushrooms, add their soaking liquid along the way,
   making sure that any grit stays behind.)
   The heat should be moderate,
   so that it bubbles in a lively but not violent way.
   The rice should take about 20 minutes total to cook.

5. When the rice is done, take if off heat and add the grated cheese and,
   if you like an even richer risotto, another nob of butter.
   Stir vigorously for about a minute,
   so that the rice becomes creamy and smooth.

             Serve immediately.

		3) Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with dusting cocoa powder on top.


	Tips: To get the most out of our banoffee pie recipe, make sure that you really boil the filling for at least 1 minute to be sure it sets to a fantastically tasty squidgy caramel. You can also use grated chocolate to decorate the pie!

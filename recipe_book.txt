Deserts

1) Banoffee Pie

	Ingredients

		Dairy
			175g melted butter
			397g Carnation Condensed Milk
			150ml carton whipping cream

		Fruit
			2 medium bananas

		Carbohydrates
			75g dark brown sugar

		Grains
			Cocoa powder

		Sweets
			225g light digestive biscuits, crushed

	Steps

		1) Put the biscuit crumbs in your bowl, then tip in the melted butter and mix it all together. Spoon this into the base and press against the bottom and sides – this is the base of the banoffee pie recipe. Chill it for ten minutes.
		2) Place 75g butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved. Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel. Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.
		3) Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate. Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base. Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with dusting cocoa powder on top.


	Tips: To get the most out of our banoffee pie recipe, make sure that you really boil the filling for at least 1 minute to be sure it sets to a fantastically tasty squidgy caramel. You can also use grated chocolate to decorate the pie!
